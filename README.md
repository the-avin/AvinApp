# Dynamic App Builder (WIP)

A pluginable desktop application that empowers users to build Android and iOS apps dynamically — with **zero manual coding**.

This tool separates the **UI**, **logic**, and **data connections**, allowing for modular and flexible app creation. It generates clean Jetpack Compose code, making development faster, more customizable, and developer-friendly.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔌 Plugin-based architecture
- ⚙️ Visual configuration of app logic and UI
- 🧱 Clear separation of concerns (UI / Logic / Data)
- 🧑‍💻 Outputs ready-to-use **Jetpack Compose** code

## 🚧 Current Status
